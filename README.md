# TypeHint Helper for Joomla!

Generate code type hints for deprecated core Joomla! API classes

## What does it do?

It lets your IDE provide code completion for the old core Joomla! API classes which have been deprecated and replaced with their
namespaced counterparts.

A picture is worth a thousand words. Here's Joomla! 3.8 staging branch on phpStorm.

## Usage

### Installation and first use

Clone this repository and initialize Composer dependencies in it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nikosdion/joomlatypehints.git
cd joomlatypehints
composer install
```

You can create typehints against either a published version of Joomla! or a Joomla! installation on your computer. The latter is
useful for core development against the staging branch.

Against a published Joomla! version, e.g. 3.7.4
```bash
php typehints.php generate --for-version=3.7.4
```

Ninja developer tip: The `--for-version` argument also accepts any published GitHub branch name for the joomla/joomla-cms repository. For example, if you want to generate typehints for the current staging branch:

```bash
php typehints.php generate --for-version=staging
``` 

Against a Joomla! installation, e.g. /var/www/joomla-cms
```bash
php typehints.php generate --for-site=/var/www/joomla-cms
```

By default the typehint classes are output in the `generated_hints` folder. You can change that by passing a folder name to the
command (the folder must already exist). For example:
```bash
php typehints.php generate --for-site=/var/www/joomla-cms /var/www/joomla-cms/typehints
```

Invoke the application without any parameters to get help. It's self-documenting!

### Using the typehints with phpStorm

* Go to File, Settings.
* From the left hand tree select Language & Frameworks, PHP.
* Click on the Include Path tab.
* Click the [+] button to the right hand of the include path list.
* Select _Specify Other..._ and select the generated class hints folder.

## How does it do it?

It reads Joomla's libraries/classmap.php file and generates fake class files so that the deprecated class extends from the new,
namespaced class. **You have to include these files in your IDE's class search path for code completion to work**. 

For example, `JRegistry` stopped existing as a standalone class in Joomla! 3.3.0. It was replaced by `\Joomla\Registry\Registry`.
Any code which was typehinted to JRegistry stopped showing code hints to developers since 3.3.0.

This utility creates a fake class definition file for this class in the form
```php
/**
 * @deprecated 4.0
 */
class JRegistry extends \Joomla\Registry\Registry {}
``` 

This lets your IDE know that even if you have used `JRegistry` in your DocBlocks / PHP 7.x type hints it should provide code
completion for the new `\Joomla\Registry\Registry` class. At the same time your IDE will mark the old `JRegistry` class as
deprecated (if it supports such a feature) so you can eventually refactor it to the new class name.
